# STS-Protocol-Implementation-with-RSA-Signatures
This project implements the Station-to-Station (STS) Protocol, a secure key exchange mechanism based on Diffie-Hellman (DH) that is enhanced with RSA digital signatures for mutual authentication.

---

## Features
You can find a description of the protocol's functionality at the following
- Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges by Whitfield Diffie [link](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/sts-final.pdf).
- Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are significant, where the entire communication process is described. 

My implementation is based on the 5.2 description.

Feel free to copy and modify.
